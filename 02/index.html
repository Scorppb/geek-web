    <h1>Dragons</h1>

        A dragon is a reptilian legendary creature that appears in the folklore 
        of many cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably 
        through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the 
        High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, 
        and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually 
        depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average 
        intelligence. Commonalities between dragons' traits are often 
        a hybridization of feline, reptilian and avian features. 
        Scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest
         resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, 
         and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.

            Chinese mythology, loong (traditional 龍, simplified 龙, Japanese simplified 竜, Pinyin lóng),
            which is associated with good fortune, and many East Asian deities and demigods have dragons
            as their personal mounts or companions. Dragons were also identified with the Emperor of China,
            who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons 
            on his house, clothing, or personal articles.

            Very occasionally a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the 
            Yeouiju (여의주), the Korean name for the mythical Cintamani, in its claws or its mouth. 
            It was said that whoever could wield the Yeouiju was blessed with the abilities 
            of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons 
            (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough 
            to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons.

            Japanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons 
            from China. Like some other Asian dragons, most Japanese dragons are water deities 
            associated with rainfall and bodies of water, and are typically depicted as large, 
            wingless, serpentine creatures with clawed feet.

            The Druk (Dzongkha: འབྲུག་), also known as 'Thunder Dragon', is one of the National 
            symbols of Bhutan. In the Dzongkha language, Bhutan is known as Druk Yul 
            "Land of Druk", and Bhutanese leaders are called Druk Gyalpo, "Thunder Dragon Kings". 
            The druk was adopted as an emblem by the Drukpa Lineage, which originated in Tibet 
            and later spread to Bhutan.

            In Egyptian mythology, Apep or Apophis is a giant serpentine creature who resides 
            in the Duat, the Egyptian Underworld. The Bremner-Rhind papyrus, written in 
            around 310 BC, preserves an account of a much older Egyptian tradition that the 
            setting of the sun is caused by Ra descending to the Duat to battle Apep.

            The ancient Greek word usually translated as "dragon" (δράκων drákōn, genitive δράκοντοϛ drákontos) 
            could also mean "snake", but it usually refers to a kind of giant serpent that either 
            possesses supernatural characteristics or is otherwise controlled by some supernatural power.

            The Roman poet Virgil in his poem Culex, lines 163–201, describing a shepherd having 
            a fight with a big constricting snake, calls it "serpens" and also "draco", 
            showing that in his time the two words were probably interchangeable.

            In the Old Norse poem Grímnismál in the Poetic Edda, the dragon Níðhöggr is described 
            as gnawing on the roots of Yggdrasil, the world tree. In Norse mythology, Jörmungandr

            In Russian and Ukrainian folklore, Zmey Gorynych is a dragon with three heads, 
            each one bearing twin goatlike horns. He is said to have breathed fire and 
            smelled of sulfur. It was believed that eclipses were caused by Gorynych 
            temporarily swallowing the sun.
